import random as random:

f_g for first group
s_g for second group
t_g for third group
board_row as sum of f_g, s_g, and t_g

x_win to know if the x wins
o_win to know if the o wins

for i in range(10) as this will dictate the game will be running:
		if the the board_row sum is not yet reach to 9:
			will picked a  number and picked a letter from list of x and o based on the
			picked number
		if the first group is already filled, the adding to first group will be false:
			
		if the second group is already filled, the adding to second group will be false:

		if the third group is already filled, the adding to third group will be false:

		detect if the x win in a first group and add increment the x win variable
		detect if the x win in a first group and add increment the x win variable

		will detect how many x wins 
		and detect how many o wins
	
		and display the result in each game.
