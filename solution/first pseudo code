i just import the random
	i added a first group i call it f_g
	i added again a second group i call it s_g
	i added again a third group i call it t_g

	and i get the sum if the groups i created and i call it board_sum

	and i created a paragraph called "x_win" and i assigned a value of empty  value
	and i created a paragraph called "o_win" and i assigned a value of empty  value

	and i created a paragraph called "x_win_list" to hold how many times the x win
	and i assigned a value of zero

	and i created a paragraph called "o_win_list" to hold how many times the x win
	and i assigned a value of zero

	and i created a function to run the game for 10 times
	and im watching for the board length if its already 9 marks, it means the game is over
		if its not yet equal to 9
			it keep on picking a letters from my letters collection, i created a list
				of characters its a total of 300 words, and it only consist of "x" and "o"

		the way i picked a letter from list of letters is by ramdom, 

		and i made a codition that if i picked a number greater than 100 , the letter should be
		added to the f_g(first group)


		and i made a codition that if i picked a number greater than 200 , the letter should be
		added to the s_g(second group)

		if the picked number is not greater than 200 and less than 100 , the letter will be added
			to the third group
